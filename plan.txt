1: Make a rock paper scissors game.  Game will be human vs computer best of 5.  Computer will choose at random.

Is there a UI?  If so sketch that out, what is its functionality.
	-What inputs will the program have.  
	-Where will the data for the inputs come from?
	-What are the desired outputs?
	-Based on the inputs, what do you have to do to get to your outputs.  This is the algorithim design.
		-Iterate psuedo coding this out

No UI, console only
Input is text, three choices
Input will come from console
Output is W/L each round and a best of 5 record

X-start game loop
prompt for the user's  input
check for case?
check for spelling?
calculate the computer's outputs
determine winner
update record
x-repeat until 5 rounds
calculate winner
display winner

Features: Human vs computer
Function called computer play, returns one option at random
FUnction: plays a single round of game, takes player selection and computer selections, returns the results

player slection is case-insensitive
    rock, ROCK, RocK, r, R etc all work

Game function, best of 5 keeps track
Add a game loop
console.log to display results of each round
prompt() to get user input
